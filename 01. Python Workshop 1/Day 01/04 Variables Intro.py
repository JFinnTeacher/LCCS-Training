#V01 - First one
# print("Hi Alex - Your fav colour is red")
# print("Goodbye Alex")

#V02 - Variable
# two ways of doing variables - Underscore option is common to Python
#Cammo style is common to others personName instead of person_name
#Important is to be consistant with defining variables

# person_name = "John"
# favourite_colour = "blue"
# print("Hi", person_name, "- your favourite colour is", favourite_colour)
# print("Goodbye ", person_name)

#V03 - Inputs
#Input asks for an input and stores this in the variable
person_name = input("Enter your name: ")
favourite_colour = input("What is your favourite colour: ")
print("Hi", person_name, "- your favourite colour is", favourite_colour)
print("Goodbye ", person_name)

x = 3+4
x = x+1
print(x)
